      "Documents: [Document(page_content='On April 23, 1843, nine men unearthed human bones and six small, bell-shaped plates in Kinderhook, Illinois, situated about seventy miles south of Nauvoo. Both sides of the plates apparently contained some sort of ancient writings. This discovery was reported in the Quincy Whig and then reprinted in the Times and Seasons (May 1, 1843, 185–87). The plates, later known as the Kinderhook Plates, made their way to Nauvoo and were presented to Joseph Smith, who was reported to have said, according to the History of the Church, “I have translated a portion of them, and find they contain the history of the person with whom they were found. He was a descendant of Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the Ruler of heaven and earth.” [\\\\[1\\\\]](#_note-1)\\n\\nIn later letters, two eyewitnesses to the event, W. P. Harris (1855) and Wilbur Fugate (1879), confessed that the whole thing was a hoax. With a group of other conspirators, they had manufactured the plates to give them the appearance of antiquity, buried them in a mound, and later pretended to excavate them, all for the purpose of trapping Joseph Smith into pretending to translate. However, it was not until 1980, when the only remaining plate was forensically examined, that the plates were conclusively determined to be, in fact, a nineteenth-century production. [\\\\[2\\\\]](#_note-2)\\n Up to 1980 most Latter-day Saints rejected the confessions and believed the plates were authentic. Not only did skeptics accept the confessors’ statements, but some continue to this day to argue that Joseph Smith pretended to translate a portion of the faked plates, claiming that he could not have been a true prophet.\\n\\nSince 1980 the question of authenticity has been answered and will not be dealt with here, except to say that Latter-day Saints (such as those who firmly believed the plates were authentic) are not immune to sometimes accepting information that is not correct. The central question now is whether Joseph Smith actually translated the plates. As one considers this question, it is important to keep a few things in mind: (1) Church history tells us that this is not the first time someone tried to lay a “translation trap” for Joseph Smith; (2) the remaining sources exhibit some ambiguity in regard to the possibility of Joseph Smith translating the plates; and (3) based on his previous pattern of dealing with revelation and scripture, either Joseph quickly lost interest when no revelation came or he did not view the Kinderhook Plates as sacred.\\n\\nKinderhook as an Echo of the Lost 116 Pages\\n\\nMost Latter-day Saints know that Joseph Smith gave Martin Harris 116 pages of the Book of Mormon manuscript and that Harris subsequently lost them. Doctrine and Covenants 10 contains the Lord’s counsel to Joseph concerning the lost 116 pages and has some relevance to the Kinderhook Plates situation: “Wicked men have taken them from you” and “Satan hath put it into their hearts to alter the words which you have caused to be written, or which you have translated, which have gone out of your hands” (vv. 8, 10). According to the revelation, the “translation trap” involved Joseph’s enemies encouraging him to retranslate the lost pages (see v. 15) and then comparing the retranslation to the altered translation (see v. 17). Then it could be proclaimed “that he has lied in his words, and that he has no gift” (v. 18). Of course, Joseph never retranslated the missing pages, but he went through a difficult repentance process that included losing his ability to translate for a season. No doubt this left an enduring impression upon him concerning his sacred duty to guard revelation and scripture.\\n\\nAccording to the confession of Wilbur Fugate, one of the nine original eyewitnesses, the idea of the Kinderhook Plates was to “prove the prophecy” that “‘Truth is yet to spring up out of the earth’ . . . by way of a joke.” [\\\\[3\\\\]](#_note-3)\\n Fugate claims that he and two others hatched the plan and that most of the people present at the digging had no idea what was really going on. It is possible that Fugate’s phrase “by way of a joke” was initially aimed at members of the Church in general, but when Joseph showed interest in the plates, the forgers realized that the Prophet’s translation abilities could be put on the line. Put simply, in translating the Kinderhook Plates, Joseph Smith would show himself to be a bogus prophet who produced a bogus translation from bogus plates.', metadata={'description': 'Critics argue that the Kinderhook Plates represent a case study of Joseph Smith’s translation ability.

[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_note-6)\\n However, only three sources from that time period deal with the translation question to any degree. The first is the statement from History of the Church cited at the beginning of this essay. Second is a letter Parley P. Pratt wrote to John Van Cott. The third is a letter from Charlotte Haven. As will be seen, these sources are ambiguous about whether Joseph Smith actually translated any of the Kinderhook Plates.\\n\\nWilliam Clayton wrote the entry for History of the Church dated May 1, 1843. In my view, it is the strongest evidence for Joseph translating a portion of the plates. In an important Ensign article, Stanley B. Kimball brought out two main concerns about Clayton’s entry. He found that the entry was added in 1909 and is based on Clayton’s May 1843 journal entry that was published in the Millennial Star in 1859. His original journal entry reads, “I have seen 6 brass plates which were found in Adams County. . . . President Joseph has translated a portion and says they contain the history of the person with whom they were found and he was a descendant of Ham through the loins of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the ruler of heaven and earth.” [\\\\[7\\\\]](#_note-7)\\n In 1909, when this journal entry was included in the History of the Church, the first part was changed to read “I have translated a portion of them,” implying that Joseph Smith was the author of the statement instead of William Clayton. Kimball said that this change was unfortunate but also pointed out that it was not an uncommon practice in the nineteenth century to write narrative in the first person when producing a biographical work. [\\\\[8\\\\]](#_note-8)\\n\\nKimball also expressed concern that Clayton’s journal entry may be based on speculation circulating at the time; he concluded that “as much misinformation and hearsay was current among people as there was fact.” He finds compelling support for this viewpoint in discrepancies between Clayton’s entry and Parley P. Pratt’s letter, such as Clayton’s claim that the discovery was made in Adams County, while Pratt says (correctly) that it was in Pike County (Pratt does not contradict Clayton’s translation statement). [\\\\[9\\\\]](#_note-9)\\n This could lead one to suspect that Clayton’s statement about Joseph Smith translating some of the plates is based on hearsay.', metadata={'description': 'Critics argue that the Kinderhook Plates represent a case study of Joseph Smith’s translation ability.

They accept that the plates were a forgery, but they strongly contend that Joseph Smith tried to translate them. Critics maintain this position based on documentary evidence from the period. Latter-day Saint researchers have also concurred that the plates were a forgery but have argued against the idea that Joseph Smith actually translated any of them. So the question remains as to whether the Prophet actually tried to translate the Kinderhook Plates or not.', 'pageStatusCode': 200, 'sourceURL': 'https://rsc.byu.edu/no-weapon-shall-prosper/did-joseph-smith-translate-kinderhook-plates', 'title': 'Did Joseph Smith Translate the Kinderhook Plates? | Religious Studies Center'})]\n",
      "Generation: The question of whether Joseph Smith translated the Kinderhook Plates remains ambiguous. According to the retrieved documents, there are several key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Claim**: The \"History of the Church\" reports that Joseph Smith stated he had translated a portion of the Kinderhook Plates and found that they contained a historical account of a descendant of Ham (source: [Religious Studies Center](https://rsc.byu.edu/no-weapon-shall-prosper/did-joseph-smith-translate-kinderhook-plates)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Two eyewitnesses, W. P. Harris (1855) and Wilbur Fugate (1879), later confessed that the Kinderhook Plates were a hoax intended to trap Joseph Smith into pretending to translate them. These confessions were supported by a forensic examination in 1980, which confirmed the plates were a 19th-century forgery (source: [Religious Studies Center](https://rsc.byu.edu/no-weapon-shall-prosper/did-joseph-smith-translate-kinderhook-plates)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ambiguity in Sources**: The sources from the time period are not entirely clear. William Clayton's journal entry, which states that Joseph Smith translated a portion of the plates, is considered the strongest evidence but is also subject to scrutiny. The entry was later edited to imply Joseph Smith made the statement directly, which was a common but misleading practice at the time (source: [Religious Studies Center](https://rsc.byu.edu/no-weapon-shall-prosper/did-joseph-smith-translate-kinderhook-plates)).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Critics and Supporters**: Critics argue that Joseph Smith attempted to translate the plates, using this as evidence against his prophetic claims. On the other hand, some Latter-day Saint researchers argue that Joseph Smith either quickly lost interest in the plates or did not view them as sacred, thus not fully engaging in their translation (source: [Religious Studies Center](https://rsc.byu.edu/no-weapon-shall-prosper/did-joseph-smith-translate-kinderhook-plates)).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while there is some evidence suggesting that Joseph Smith may have translated a portion of the Kinderhook Plates, the reliability of these sources is questionable due to later edits and the confessions of those involved in the hoax. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether Joseph Smith genuinely attempted to translate the Kinderhook Plates.\n",
