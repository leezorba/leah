However, Latter-day Saint researchers acknowledge that while the plates were a forgery, they dispute the claim that Joseph Smith actually translated them. Instead, they suggest that he offered only a cursory translation of one symbol and did not pursue further translation (source: [Mormonr](https://mormonr.org/qnas/a9l1T/the_kinderhook_plates)).\n",

      "The Kinderhook plates are a set of six small (three inches in height), bell-shaped brass plates with inscriptions[\\[1\\]](#footnote-1) that a group of men—Wilburn Fugate,[\\[BIO\\]](#bio-1wdTUb) Robert Wiley,[\\[BIO\\]](#bio-sApvib) and Bridge Whitton[\\[BIO\\]](#bio-0Jgb4r)—forged;[\\[2\\]](#footnote-2) planted in a mound[\\[3\\]](#footnote-3) near Kinderhook, Illinois; and “excavated”[\\[4\\]](#footnote-4) in the spring of 1843. According to Fugate, the plates were fabricated as a sort of prank or joke.[\\[5\\]](#footnote-5)\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we know they are fake?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the conspirators who participated in the hoax, Wilburn Fugate, admitted to them being fakes in 1879.[\\[6\\]](#footnote-6) Modern scientific tests[\\[7\\]](#footnote-7) also confirmed that the last-known surviving plate is of modern, not ancient, origin.[\\[8\\]](#footnote-8)\n",
      "\n",
      "Was Joseph Smith tricked by the hoax?\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably not. Joseph Smith[\\[BIO\\]](#bio-RlDjab) initially took an interest[\\[9\\]](#footnote-9) in the Kinderhook plates and reportedly made an initial attempt to translate[\\[10\\]](#footnote-10) one of the characters by the secular means available to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then reportedly wanted them authenticated by an expert before he did anything more with them.[\\[11\\]](#footnote-11) The owner of the plates took them back, and Joseph never followed up or mentioned them again.[\\[12\\]](#footnote-12)\n",
      "\n",
      "But didn’t Joseph make more than a preliminary guess about the plates? Didn’t he actually try to translate them?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is evidence that indicates Joseph may have attempted to translate some portion of the plates,[\\[13\\]](#footnote-13) specifically one character. The character resembled a hieroglyph from the Egyptian papyri[\\[14\\]](#footnote-14) he acquired in the summer of 1835, and Joseph probably compared the two.\n",
